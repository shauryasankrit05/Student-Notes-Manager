Important Note About File Uploads
This is a frontend-only project. The app saves the uploaded file name, but it does not permanently store the actual file. To store real files permanently, the app would need a backend system or database storage such as Firebase, Supabase, or a custom server.

Local Storage
The app stores note data in the browser's localStorage. This means:

Notes remain available after refreshing the page.
Notes are saved only in the same browser and device.
Clearing browser data may remove saved notes.
Project Structure

All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code is kept inside the single student-notes-manager.html file.

Future Improvements

Add export/import notes as JSON
Add dark mode
Add sorting by newest, oldest, subject, or importance
